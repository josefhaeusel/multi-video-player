# 🎥 Adaptive Multi Video Player

## 📂 Importing Videos

Place your video files into the folder:  
`/museum-player-videos`  
*(This folder is automatically created during installation.)*

> 💡 **Best format:** Videos are best displayed in **1920×1080** resolution and **.mp4** format.

---

## 🏷️ Filename Format: Title & Author

To automatically extract the **Title** and **Author**, name your video files like this:

```
{Title}+++{Author}.mp4
```

### Example:
```
Cat Video+++Cat Museum Association.mp4
```

This will display as:
- **Title:** Cat Video  
- **Author:** Cat Museum Association

---

## 🖼️ Optional Cover Images

To display a **cover image** (thumbnail) for each video, save a `.jpg` image in the same folder with **the exact same filename** as the `.mp4` video.

### Example:
For the video:
```
Cat Video+++Cat Museum Association.mp4
```

Add a cover image:
```
Cat Video+++Cat Museum Association.jpg
```

> 📝 The `.jpg` must be named identically (excluding the extension) to ensure the player links it to the correct video.
